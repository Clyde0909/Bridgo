ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, the following additional
terms and conditions apply to the Work:

1.  **Restriction on Use for Paid Cloud Services (SaaS)**: 
    The Work, and any Derivative Works thereof, may not be used to provide, 
    host, or otherwise offer a paid software-as-a-service (SaaS) or any 
    similar cloud-based service where the primary offering to the end-user 
    is substantially the same as the Work or its Derivative Works, and for 
    which a fee is charged to the end-user for access or use of such service.

    For clarity:
    - This restriction applies to services where the Work or Derivative Works 
      form the core functionality being sold or offered on a subscription or 
      pay-per-use basis.
    - This restriction does NOT prevent You from using the Work internally to 
      support Your own operations, including Your own paid services, as long 
      as the Work itself is not the direct product being sold as a SaaS offering.
    - This restriction does NOT prevent You from distributing the Work or 
      Derivative Works in accordance with the other terms of the Apache License 2.0 
      (e.g., for on-premise deployments by end-users, or for inclusion in 
      larger projects that are not themselves primarily SaaS offerings of the Work).

These additional terms are intended to prevent the direct commercialization of the
Work as a standalone, paid cloud service, while still allowing for broad use and
distribution as per the Apache License 2.0.
